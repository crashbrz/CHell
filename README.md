# CHell
The CHell is a PHP shell based on cookies to execute commands.<br> 
It might bypass several controls, and monitoring due to the web servers usually does not include the cookies into log files.

## Notes ##
- CHell <chell.php> can be used as standalone .php file or backdooring an existence .php file into the server. 
- CHell by default uses JSESSION cookie name. If necessary, change it.
- Cookie value encryption was not added due to the necessity of encryption libs must be installed/loaded on the server-side.
